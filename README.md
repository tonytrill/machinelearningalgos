# Machine Learning Algorithms
### This repo is just an implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch for practice and knowledge.

The algorithms are implemented using Python 3.7. I am working on adpoting better software engineering practices in my code, so if you see anything that doesn't look like good software engineering please let me know so I can fix.

### Goals
1. Implement a number of Machine Learning Algos in Python using Numpy.
2. Boost software engineering abilities.
3. Boost machine learning abilities through understanding of different techniques.
